        <h2>🍅 What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it—by dividing work into short sessions (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (usually 5 minutes).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>25-minute focus session:</strong> Choose a task and give it your full attention.</li>
            <li><strong>5-minute break:</strong> Step away, stretch, or relax.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This method boosts focus, reduces fatigue, and creates a natural rhythm for deep work. It’s great for studying, writing, coding, or any task that requires your full attention.
